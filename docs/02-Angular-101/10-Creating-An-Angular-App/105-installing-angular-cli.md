We will install the Angular CLI globally. This means once the command installs successfully, you will have a new command (`ng`) on your path. The `ng` command is the entry-point to the Angular CLI.

⚒️ Go to a shell and run the following command. This is a global command, so it doesn't matter what directory you are in.

```shell
npm i -g @angular/cli
```
