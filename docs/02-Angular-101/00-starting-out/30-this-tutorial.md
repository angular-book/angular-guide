title: üìó This Tutorial
---

We are about ready to get into the work of creating and developing an Angular application.

We want to help you find your "way in", so to speak. You can choose, at different times, multiple "paths" through this material.

Some people will want to read the content and take it all in, and then do the "hands on" portions after they feel comfortable with the concepts involved.

Others will want to just jump to the work, play along, and get a "feel" for it, referring back to the written explanations to fill in gaps in their knowledge.

Sometimes you'll do a bit of both. 

You can choose your own adventure here. Whatever works for you.

If you are pretty comfortable with web applications and related technologies, you could just skip through to each of the documents labled with the ‚öíÔ∏è icon. These are the things you have to "do". 

The written documentation sometimes has an indicator with either a green üìó or a blue üìò book. 

The green book stuff is direct information pertaining to the steps in the lab portions (‚öíÔ∏è), You might want to at least gloss through these sections before doing each lab section to make sure you understand what it is you will be doing in that section. The blue book stuff is "bigger picture", and theory. If you don't want to be overwhelmed, feel free to skip this stuff for now. After you've gotten a little farther in your journey, you can revisit it for more insights. 

Lab sections that require you to do something, like enter commands at the command line, or write code, will give you the code to write, or the commands to run. Where appropriate, short silent videos showing you what it will look like when you run the command, for example, will be provided.

Finally, there is a video of the entire tutorial, from start to finish. The video is meant to be a *supplement* to what is provided here, but not a replacement. You might find it useful to just watch through it to get a sense of the "vibe" of what we are creating. Don't worry if there are things you don't understand or aren't explained as part of the video - those will be covered in the tutorial materials.
