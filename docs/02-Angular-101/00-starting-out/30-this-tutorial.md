We are about ready to get into the work of creating and developing an Angular application.

We want to help you find your "way in", so to speak. You can choose, at different times, multiple "paths" through this material.

Some people will want to read the content and take it all in, and then do the "hands on" portions after they feel comfortable with the concepts involved.

Others will want to just jump to the work, play along, and get a "feel" for it, referring back to the written explanations to fill in gaps in their knowledge.

Sometimes you'll do a bit of both.
