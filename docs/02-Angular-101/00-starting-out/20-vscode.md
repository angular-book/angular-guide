Angular applications are made up of text source code files. Components, services, templates, css files, etc. You will write a *lot* of TypeScript code. 

You can really use just about any editor that can work with plain text files you like. Even notepad on Windows or something like Nano or VIM would work. 

For this tutorial we recommend using Visual Studio Code. We don't want to get into a religious debate about choice of editor. We have to pick something. Visual Studio Code is free, open-source software. It contains a ton of functionality that lends it to working with Angular applications, including a suite of *extensions* built specifically for Angular. As a matter of fact, when we create a new Angular application, the template used by the Angualar team assumes you will be using Visual Studio Code and will recommend extensions for your work.

It's the easiest way to get started.

Go to [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and click the download button to install Visual Studio Code for your operating system. The "Stable" build will be adequate.

## Learning your Editor

If you are new to Visual Studio Code, it would serve you well to take *some* time familiarizing yourself with the way it works. The [documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs) is a good starting point, but probably too much for just getting started. Skip around it a bit and try a few things out. The "Get Started" section, along with the User Guide is a good place to start.

After that, take a look at the section on Source Control and the Terminal. We will use both of those pieces of functionality during this tutorial.
