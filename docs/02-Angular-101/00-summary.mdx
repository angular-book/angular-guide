# ðŸ“— Quick Tour of Angular

The best way to learn something like Angular is to just jump in and create something and get the "lay of the land", so to speak.

This guide will will help you do that, and familiarize you with the local customs in Angular. It will no doubt be different than most other frameworks you might have used in the past. 

We are going to cover a lot of ground, and aren't going to spend a lot of time (yet) talking about "best practices", or even making it look all that great or be too clever with what we are building. 

The purpose of this guide is to introduce you to something new to you. When programming with a framework like Angular, the first step is to get to know the conventions and the general "vibe" of how Angular expects you 
to structure your application.
