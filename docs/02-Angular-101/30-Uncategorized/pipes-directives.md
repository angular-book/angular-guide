# Using Pipes and Directives

## Todo

- Demonstrate some of the built-in pipes (date, currency, percent)
  - Build a custom pipe (maybe masking a SSN?)
- Directives
  - Show some of the structural directives (*ngIf, *ngFor)
  - Show using templates
  - Show using the asterisk
  - Build a couple custom directives
    - One for just adding some styling to a button or something.
    - One that is a structural directive and needs a template.
