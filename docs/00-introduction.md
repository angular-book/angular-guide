# Introduction

This is an _opinionated_ guide to creating applications with the Angular framework. Most tutorials are less opinionated - for example, the [Tour of Heroes](https://angular.io/tutorial) from the Angular website. That's a "getting started" tutorial, intended to showcase how "easy" Angular is.

This guide assumes you will be creating applications with Angular that have a lot more complexity, higher stakes, and that you'll be building this application as part of a team of developers.

Some of the opinions here will be _technical_. For example, we are going to assume you will be using Git for source code control. We are also going to assume you will be using Visual Studio Code as your primary editor, and Bash, or a Bash-like shell for your terminal.

Some of the opinions will be _architectural_. The authors have years of experience building large-scale Angular applications, and will promote those patterns and practices here that will, to the best of our knowledge, serve you and your team well when you are in it for the long-haul.

In other words, some guides are designed to help you get started, but leave the big questions up to you. It's compelling to write a guide like that because it would be, frankly, much easier. The problem is, you will only be "getting started" for a relatively small portion of the time you are working in Angular. By front-loading your skills with some advanced knowledge, and making sound architectural decisions early on, your ongoing velocity will be much more normalized.
