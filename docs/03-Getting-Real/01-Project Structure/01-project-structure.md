# Project Structure

We are going to make some big jumps here from what you've done in the Angular 101 section.

Angular 101 _might_ be all you need, if:

- You don't work with a team of developers (solo work)
- You don't have frequently changing requirements
- You expect your application to be mostly a "one and done" deal - you write it, deliver it, and then you move on.
- You are just a hobbiest and just want to know what Angular is all about.

## Professional "Enterprise" Angular Development

In this section we want to share with you the "good practices" for creating, testing, maintaining, and deploying production-ready Angular applications.

We use the term "Enterprise" here in the best sense - here we mean:

- You are working as a developer on an application to provide business value.
- You want to deliver new features quickly, while limiting liability from regressions, etc.
- Your team wants to work independently from other teams, including teams creating APIs and services.
- The makeup of your team changes over time.
