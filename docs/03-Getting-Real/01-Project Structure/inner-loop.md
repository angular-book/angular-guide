# ESLint and Prettier

> A Lot of Work needs done here.

This is inner-loop stuff.

- TSConfig
- ESLint
- EditorConfig
- Prettier

We have several tools that each have their sweet spot in what they support/provide

They also have a lot of overlap. For example, you can specify what kind of quotes you want to use in each of those.

So, where do you do each thing:

## TSConfig

Leave formatting, etc. out of this. This is just the bare-bones configuration for TypeScript.

## ESLint

Subjective, team based code "good practices".

## Editor Config

Nah. But prettier can and does use the rules here.

## Prettier

Code formatting.
