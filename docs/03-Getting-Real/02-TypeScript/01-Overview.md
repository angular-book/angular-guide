# TypeScript Overview

Often, newer developers like TypeScript because of the _inner-loop_ feedback it provides in terms of things like code-completion and compiler feedback.

Some developers feel like it is an unnessecary hurdle and think "Why can't I just write JavaScript?"

Expert developers like TypeScript because it allows them to design and think in _types_. This is what we are going for here. We aren't using TypeScript to set up unnecessary ritual and hurdles to delivering quality code. We are using it to make our code more expressive, make it more resilient to refactoring, and making it so that we can _move faster_ with _more confidence_.
