We are trying to fill the gap between the two most common ways people try to learn something like Angular. On the one hand, there are tons of tutorial videos. You watch someone build a specific thing, only explaining what they need to explain for their *application* of whatever they are showing. You might try to code along, keep up, but mostly you just watch and try to absorb. On the other hand, there is the documentation, which is largely a context-free listing of "stuff". 

Videos are great if you already know *most* of the stuff. You can speed them up, skip around. They can get you at least started, in most cases.

Documentation is usually, even at the best, pretty sparse and direct. Maybe a bunch of "here is how you do this *thingy*", but not a lot of "why would I do that thing?", or "why did they decide to do it that way?". You often end of copying and pasting from the docs (or StackOverflow, etc.), often without a lot of deep understanding of what is going on with the code. But you must ship code.

A traditional book might talk you through a lot of that stuff, but who has time for that? And a lot of prolix discussion about theory doesn't mean much if you don't even know how to compile a basic application.

We want to promote an *iterative* learning style. Everyone comes to a new technology with a different set of skills and experiences. Some have been doing web development for years, but primarily server-side. Some have used vanilla JavaScript a ton, some come from other frameworks or libraries, and others may have never written an angle bracket in anger before in their lives.

In these guides, we want to give you a linear approach to learning Angular, but give you the freedom to jump round as you need. You might go for the "show me the money" route and just do the labs, and *then* go back and read some of the details. The big picture stuff can be added after you feel like you have a little more of this "under your fingers" so to speak. 

Or maybe you start with the Big Picture stuff. Read through it. Ponder it on a walk, or in the bathtub. And then work your way in to applying it.

Knowledge and skill does accrete over time. You get better, you have better conceptual models, etc. but it isn't always linear. A framework like Angular lets you do some *amazing* stuff in manipulating the DOM, applying animations, working with APIs, etc. and you might not, for a long time, really know what it is doing behind the scenes. You could spend a career not knowing of the existence of the XMLHttpRequest object or the fetch API, but you'll use them (indirectly) in your very first application.

The question is, then, is it better to learn *all* that stuff before hand, before you create your first Angular application? The Mozilla Developer Network has put together a training program that will take you from zero to Web Developer. You can look at it here [MDN Learn Frontend Development](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Front-end_web_developer). It's good stuff. We added up the time for each "course" and it is about 36 weeks. And *then*, they suggest, you can learn something like Angular or React.

You have to know *some* HTML. The more the better. The same with CSS, and, of course, programming with JavaScript.

It is *hard* to learn like that, though. We've tried to teach that way. For a lot of people, they get to the point where they think "well, that little cool CSS trick is neat, but..." something is left out. The context on *why* you'd need this. It's that old "Knowledge vs. Wisdom" thing - you can accumulate a lot of knowledge, but how do you know if the knowledge is useful until you have applied it to something?

This is, at it's heart, the problem with classroom, instructor-led training for people beginning in a new area of technology. An instructor can give you the *experience* of creating something, like an Angular application, they can give you *some* knowledge - usually specific to the thing you are building together, or in the labs - but there is never enough time for you to absorb those bits of knowledge in a generally applicable way. You have to have some time to do that work. And no two paths will be the same.
